<p><strong><em>17, <a href="http://mkaysi.github.com/Asperger.html">AS</a>, Linux user since 2008, currently using <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>, interested in computers and some kind of Finnish translator.</em></strong></p>
<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
<p>My name is Mika Suomalainen. I am probably more known with my nickname <em>Mkaysi</em>. I am seventeen years old, even though people often think that I am older which can probably be explained with my <a href="http://mkaysi.github.com/Asperger.html">Asperger's syndrome</a>. I started using Linux in 2008 and the distribution was <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> 8.04 Hardy Heron. I am currently using <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>. I am interested in computers. I am also some kind of Finnish translator.</p>
<h2 id="aspergers-syndrome-as">Asperger's Syndrome (AS)</h2>
<p>Asperger's Syndrome causes me different kinds of problems, but has also positive things. For example, I can easily remember things which are related to computers, like how I usually set up some operating system. More about it <a href="http://mkaysi.github.com/Asperger.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>As I said, I started using Linux in 2008 and the distribution was <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. But <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> wasn't the first distribution, that I used, it was the first distribution which I installed.</p>
<h3 id="damn-small-linux">Damn Small Linux</h3>
<p>I started testing Linux using <a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a> on USB stick. I didn't do very much with it and I don't think that you can do very much with it when compared to some other distribution.</p>
<h3 id="ubuntu">Ubuntu</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> was the first distribution that I installed. The release was 8.04 Hardy Heron. I stayed fully in Ubuntu some years before I got involved with Limnoria and that was when I started trying other distributions.</p>
<h3 id="debian">Debian</h3>
<p>People in <a href="http://supybot.fr.cr/">Limnoria</a> got me to try <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> Sid (unstable) and I liked it, because it usually had newer packages than <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and I used it a long time. I did ever manage to crash it if we don't count installing closed <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html">nVidia</a> display driver and using <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianExperimental">Debian</a> with higher priority than is sane.</p>
<h3 id="arch-linux">Arch Linux</h3>
<p>I also tried <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> and <a href="http://archbang.org/">ArchBang</a>, but I didn't get positive experience with them. My experiences were just &quot;install, upgrade, crash&quot; multiple times.</p>
<h3 id="linux-mint-debian-edition">Linux Mint Debian Edition</h3>
<p>I used <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php">LMDE</a> with netbook for some time, but I wasn't able to get <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd">systemd</a> into it when I upgraded it to <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> Sid.</p>
<h2 id="fedora">Fedora</h2>
<p>I once tried to install <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> to one computer which had problem with current Linux kernel in <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> (&gt;10.04, I don't remember which), but as <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> had the same kernel, it didn't succeed. This issue was solved by installing <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> (&gt;10.04, I still don't remember which) Alpha release.</p>
<p>I didn't have any interest towards <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> until recently when teacher at my current school started recommending it and we had to install it. At the end my interest towards <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> awake when I noticed features which weren't taught, delta packages and fastest-mirror.</p>
<p>Delta packages allow downloading only changes in packages instead of whole packages and fastest-mirror's name says what it does.</p>
<p>Of course delta packages exist with <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> too, but they aren't used by default and they are harder to use, aren't officially supported, have only one mirror. In <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> just install updates and they are used automatically.</p>
<p>The fastest-mirror is also with <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, but not enabled by default and it's server side. With <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> there is <a href="http://mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt">one dynamic file</a> on mirrors.ubuntu.com that contains the list of near mirrors and with <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> there is <a href="http://http.debian.net/">Debian</a> which is server side too. If either of these goes down, you can't upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> also has promise to try to keep the latest upstream versions, so I got the new <a href="http://www.enigmail.net/home/index.php">Enigmail</a> faster than I would got with <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.</p>
