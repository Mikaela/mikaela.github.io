### Not code

#### Photos/Videos/Audio

**This doesn't include screenshots and most things not taken with camera/microphone.**

Photos/Videos/Audio by me which don't include license mentioning are licenced under 
Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported license aka [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/).

### Whom to attribute with Creative Commons licenses?

My name is **Mikaela Suomalainen** and my homepage is **http://mkaysi.github.io/** .
I would like at least this information be attributed and if you want you 
can also attribute **Mikaela Suomalainen (Mkaysi)** with homepage **http://mkaysi.github.io/ .**

### Why do you have "default licences" for works that don't mention license?

**Licences under this bolded message don't have anything to do with my work.
For information about my works, read above!**

I have "signed" [Fedora Project Contributor Agreement](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contributor_Agreement?rd=Legal:FPCA) which specifies 
default licences of signers if they haven't specified their own licences.

The licences which they specify are MIT license for code and 
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC-BY-SA) with
section 4d waived for everything else.
