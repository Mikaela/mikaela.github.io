***17, [AS](http://mkaysi.github.com/Asperger.html),  Linux user since 2008, currently using [Fedora], interested in computers and some kind of Finnish translator.***

About me
========

My name is Mikaelaelaela Suomalainen. I am probably more known with my nickname *Mkaysi*. I am seventeen years old, even though people often think that I am older 
which can probably be explained with my [Asperger's syndrome](http://mkaysi.github.com/Asperger.html). 
I started using Linux in 2008 and the distribution was [Ubuntu] 8.04 
Hardy Heron. I am currently using [Fedora]. I am interested in computers. 
I am also some kind of Finnish translator.

[Ubuntu]:http://www.ubuntu.com/

Asperger's Syndrome (AS)
------------------------

Asperger's Syndrome causes me different kinds of problems, but has also
positive things. For example, I can easily remember things which are 
related to computers, like how I usually set up some operating system.
More about it [here](http://mkaysi.github.com/Asperger.html).

Linux
-----

As I said, I started using Linux in 2008 and the distribution was [Ubuntu]. 
But [Ubuntu] wasn't the first distribution, that I used, it was the first 
distribution which I installed.

[Ubuntu]:http://www.ubuntu.com/

### Damn Small Linux

I started testing Linux using [Damn Small Linux] on USB stick. I didn't do 
very much with it and I don't think that you can do very much with it 
when compared to some other distribution.

[Damn Small Linux]:http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/

### Ubuntu

[Ubuntu] was the first distribution that I installed. The release was 8.04 
Hardy Heron. I stayed fully in Ubuntu some years before I got involved 
with Limnoria and that was when I started trying other distributions.

[Ubuntu]:http://www.ubuntu.com/

### Debian

People in [Limnoria] got me to try [Debian] Sid (unstable) and I liked it, 
because it usually had newer packages than [Ubuntu] and I used it a long
time. I did ever manage  to crash it if we don't count installing closed
[nVidia] display driver and using [Debian] [Experimental] with higher priority 
than is sane.

[Debian]:http://www.debian.org/
[Ubuntu]:http://www.ubuntu.com/
[nVidia]:http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html
[Experimental]:http://wiki.debian.org/DebianExperimental

### Arch Linux

I also tried [Arch Linux] and [ArchBang], but I didn't get positive experience with them. 
My experiences were just "install, upgrade, crash" multiple times.

[Arch Linux]:https://www.archlinux.org/
[ArchBang]:http://archbang.org/

### Linux Mint Debian Edition

I used [LMDE] with netbook for some time, but I wasn't able to get [systemd] 
into it when I upgraded it to [Debian] Sid.

[LMDE]:http://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php
[systemd]:http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd
[Debian]:http://www.debian.org/

## Fedora

I once tried to install [Fedora] to one computer which had problem with 
current Linux kernel in [Ubuntu] (>10.04, I don't remember which), but as
[Fedora] had the same kernel, it didn't succeed. This issue was solved by 
installing [Ubuntu] (>10.04, I still don't remember which) Alpha release.

I didn't have any interest towards [Fedora] until recently when teacher at 
my current school started recommending it and we had to install it. At the 
end my interest towards [Fedora] awake when I noticed features which weren't 
taught, delta packages and fastest-mirror.

Delta packages allow downloading only changes in packages instead of whole 
packages and fastest-mirror's name says what it does.

Of course delta packages exist with [Debian] and [Ubuntu] too, but they aren't 
used by default and they are harder to use, aren't officially supported, 
have only one mirror. In [Fedora] just install updates and they are used 
automatically.

The fastest-mirror is also with [Ubuntu] and [Debian], but not enabled by 
default and it's server side. With [Ubuntu] there is [one dynamic file] on 
mirrors.ubuntu.com that contains the list of near mirrors and with [Debian]
there is [Debian] [HTTP redirector] which is server side too. If either of 
these goes down, you can't upgrade.

[Fedora] also has promise to try to keep the latest upstream versions, so I 
got the new [Enigmail] faster than I would got with [Debian] and [Ubuntu].

### Limnoria

*[Limnoria] is an IRC bot which is fork of popular IRC bot known as [Supybot]*

I have translated [Limnoria] to Finnish, but as I wasn't experienced in 
translating, the quality is varying. If you use [Limnoria], please 
[report issues] with the translations and I will take a look at them.

### Ubuntu

I am on some of [Ubuntu]'s IRC channels and mailing lists and have helped

is nowadays little inactive.

### Debian

I wasn't so much on their IRC channels, because they are at [OFTC] instead of
[freenode], but I am on some of their mailing lists and I have helped with 
some problems there.

### Fedora

I am on some of [Fedora]'s IRC channels on [freenode] and [IRCnet] and have helped

[Fedora] pages which were outdated before we fixed them.

As I said previously, I helped updating pages about [Fedora at Linux.fi],
