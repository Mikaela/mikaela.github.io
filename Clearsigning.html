Why do you GPG clearsign your emails instead of using PGP/MIME or something less spammy?
    I am clearsigning my emails instead of using PGP/MIME, because I am on 
multiple mailing lists and most of them use mailing list software, 
which messes up with headers and this way make PGP/MIME signatures 
unverifiable.
    I know that clearsigned messages may look ugly to email clients, which
don't support PGP, but they can at least be verified on all mailing lists.
