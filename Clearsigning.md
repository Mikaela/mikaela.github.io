Why do you GPG clearsign your emails instead of using PGP/MIME or something less spammy?
========================================================================================

I am clearsigning my emails instead of using PGP/MIME, because I am on 
multiple mailing lists and most of them use mailing list software, 
which messes up with headers and this way make PGP/MIME signatures 
unverifiable.
    
But clearsigned signature looks ugly.
=====================================
    
I know that clearsigned messages may look ugly to email clients, which
don't support PGP, but they can at least be verified on all mailing lists.

I am on slow connection and your signature is too big for me.
=============================================================

I am sorry for that. But keep in mind that your email client would stll
download ther PGG/MIME signature (signature.asc) file even if I used
PGP/MIME.
