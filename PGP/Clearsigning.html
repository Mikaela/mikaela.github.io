<p>I am clearsigning my emails instead of using PGP/MIME, because I am on multiple mailing lists and most of them use mailing list software, which messes up with headers and this way make PGP/MIME signatures unverifiable.</p>
<h2 id="but-clearsigned-signature-looks-ugly.">But clearsigned signature looks ugly.</h2>
<p>I know that clearsigned messages may look ugly to email clients, which don't support PGP, but they can at least be verified on all mailing lists.</p>
<h2 id="i-am-on-slow-connection-and-your-signature-is-too-big-for-me.">I am on slow connection and your signature is too big for me.</h2>
<p>I am sorry for that. But keep in mind that your email client would still download ther PGP/MIME signature (signature.asc) file even if I used PGP/MIME.</p>
