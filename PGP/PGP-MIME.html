<h1 id="pgpmime">PGP/MIME</h1>
<p>I am trying to start using PGP/MIME (again). Last time it failed, because there are some mailing lists, which don't work with PGP/MIME and I didn't know how to sync Enigmail P-R rules.</p>
<h1 id="are-you-on-a-mailing-list-and-have-problems-with-verifying-pgpmime-signed-emails-by-me">Are you on a mailing list and have problems with verifying PGP/MIME signed emails by me?</h1>
<p>If the answer is yes, then please inform me about this issue and I will set Enigmail to use PGP/INLINE with that mailing lists.</p>
<p>My contact details can be found in my <a href="key.txt">PGP key</a>.</p>
