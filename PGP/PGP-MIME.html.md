# PGP/MIME

I am trying to start using PGP/MIME (again). Last time it failed, because 
there are some mailing lists, which don't work with PGP/MIME and I didn't know
how to sync Enigmail P-R rules. 

# Are you on a mailing list and have problems with verifying PGP/MIME signed emails by me?

If the answer is yes, then please inform me about this issue and I will set
Enigmail to use PGP/INLINE with that mailing lists.

My contact details can be found in my [PGP key].
