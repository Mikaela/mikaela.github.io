This website should be fairly typical Jekyll project. The index contains
`rel=me` links everywhere so projects such as Mastodon give me the green
checkmark.

## Sitemaps

- `sitemap.xml` — automatically generated by Jekyll when building
- `sitemaps.xml` — manually written sitemap index pointing to sitemaps on my
  sites. I am not sure how it works when there are multiple domains, so I am
  keeping all sitemaps in robots.txt and sitemaps.xml on bottom of it. Same will
  possibly happen with other domains.

## Unusual directories

Or directories that generally aren't encountered in other similar projects.

- `n/` - quick notes for my personal reference with memorable addresses.
- `r/` - my personal url redirector for links that I have to refer to more or
  less often.
- `txt/` - signed text files such as account list to decrease impact of identity
  theft attempts.
- `PGP/` - my current and some previous PGP keys.

### Submodules

- `ir/` - list of I2P services, previously a part of this repository for
  memorable addresses.
- `lfs-media/` - orphan branch containing lfs-media such as the avatars. However
  it doesn't work with GitHub pages.
- `or/` - same as `ir/`, but for Tor Onion Services.

## Building

1. Install `bundler` onto your system.
1. `cd` to root of this repository, if you didn't already.
1. _Optionally_ configure where you wish bundler to install everything. This
   repository already specifies `bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'`
   in the gitignored `.bundle/config` file.
1. Run `bundle install`
1. You are done, `bundle exec jekyll <build|serve>` and similar commands should
   work, just remember `bundle exec` in front of the command so the system wide
   installation doesn't unintentionally get used.
