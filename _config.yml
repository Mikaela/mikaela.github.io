# {{site.ipfsGateway}}/ipfs/IPFSHASHHERE to get ipfs link via gateway.
# Hopefully future proof letting me simply swap the link here instead of
# changing it everywhere.
# IMPORTANT! When adding content, either add a directory with
# `ipfs add -r` OR SINGLE FILE `ipfs add -w file` so a new directory gets
# created for the content and when it's used, the filename and type are
# remembered which may be helpful with media files or embeds.
# Note: no trailing slash after the URL, only https://domain.tld
ipfsGateway: https://gateway.ipfs.io
# I am not sure how to use this, but I want it to exist anyway
#   Remember: `ipfs cid base32 <the usual hash>`
