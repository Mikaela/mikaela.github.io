Please consider installing one to protect yourself, and your close ones, from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-dont-we-just-ban-targeted-advertising/">manipulation</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvertising">targeted malvertising</a>!
<a href="https://privacybadger.org">Privacy Badger</a> will take care of third-party tracking the best, but hiding this message takes a more targeted filter such as <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/master/README.md#ublock-origin-ubo">uBlock Origin (for Firefox)</a> or <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/blob/main/README.md#ubo-lite">uBlock Origin Lite (for everything else)</a>.
Additionally considering adblocking DNS services such as <a href="https://www.joindns4.eu/for-public">DNS4EU Protective Resolution With Ad blocking</a> or <a href="https://adguard-dns.io/public-dns.html">public AdGuard DNS</a> may be a good idea to clean up your modern internet.

<small>PS. I am not sorry if this cosmetic filtering targeting script doesn't detect your protection, because this message brings me too many amused messages and smiles for that (and thus this message is here to stay) 🐾</small>
