*I seem to have to tweet to Telegram often and as I refer to those tweets
 often, why to not have them on single post which to update now and then?*

*If I could get 0,01€ every time this was said... My reported for spam

*Just because I am a woman doesn't mean I am obligated to talk with you or
 any of those dozens of other blocked people. Masculine presenting people
 are always surprised when they hear of this phenomeon...*

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="fi"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/telegram">@telegram</a> Why group foundership cannot be transferred either manually or automatically to some admin?</p>&mdash; Mikaela Suomalainen (@Inaneierase) <a href="https://twitter.com/Inaneierase/status/774572918206558208">10. syyskuuta 2016</a></blockquote>

*There were the two Antergos groups that I had to remove in order to get
out of that poisonous environment, founder in one peer support group got
tired and removed the group after it was migrated elsewhere safely and
Finnish Ingress Cross Faction group was removed by the owner.*

*Atheme would manage this by allowing the founder to make someone else
founder or if the founder account was removed, moving the founder access to
whoever was marked as successor or had the highest flags.*

*When someone removes their Telegram accounts, I have understood that the
groups stay, but everyone who was there at that moment becomes irreversibly
some kind of admin being able to remove everyone joining after that
moment.*

*The last edit on this page happened on 2016-09-29T15:47+0300 unless they
 bother replying in which case I probably won't update this text which
 I wrote before any replies. If you see Telegram reply below my text, 
 have updated this. I don't think I will get a reply based on their
 earlier replying activity...*
