GirlsLikeUs (trans woman) & AS (Asperger's Syndrome)
----------------------------------------------------

I am not sure what I should say about this. There are just trolls
attacking me too often, because I am *"misleading everyone by acting like a
girl"*. This is simply not the case. I was just misdefined as male at birth
while you probably defined correctly at birth.

Asperger's syndrome again means that I am always not sure what to say,
I have over sensitive senses and I usually say what I mean directly. This
can also be called as *"issues in social situations"*.
