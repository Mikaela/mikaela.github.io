Sexuality
---------

This one has nothing to do with you, but there are trolls who are worried
that I am *"acting like a girl among sexually desperate online nerds*".
I am not anywhere where sex or sexuality is on-topic at IRC where this was
said. Sadly there are some places which indeed are sexual and I am simply
reporting these and leaving. Most of cases have been took care of.

If you are still more interested on my sexuality than you should, I
identify as *demiromantic asexual*, but you might have heard me call myself
as *demisexual* too.
