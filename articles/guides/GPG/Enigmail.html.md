# Quick Enigmail guide.

# What do you need

This depends on your OS. You should also read my previous guides about GPG and Icedove / Thunderbird.

## Debian based distributins

You need at least packages icedove or thunderbird and enigmail, but I recommend you to install gnupg2 and pinentry packages too.

> aptitude install thunderbird enigmail gnupg2 pinentry-curses pinentry-gtk2 pinentry-qt4

NOTE: In Debian Thunderbird is called Icedove and the package is icedove.

## Mac OS X

You need PGP-tools, Thunderbird and Enigmail

## Windows

You need GPG4Win, Thunderbird and Enigmail.

# Running the Enigmail wizard.

If Enigmail wizard doesn't appear by itself, open it manually from OpenPGP (menu) --> Enigmail wizard.

NOTE: Allow wizard to do changes, which it wants.

## Enable viewing messages in original HTML.

## If the wizard fails

Write with computer

## Sending UTF-8

Write to Icedove / Thunderbird guide.

# Testing that everything works

Write about Adele


# Sending PGP/MIME instead of PGP/INLINE

I personally don't recommend this, because of my reasons. PGP/MIME puts the signature to signature.asc attachment and PGP/INLINE into "mess" in the bottom of email.
