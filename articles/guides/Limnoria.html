<h1 id="installing">Installing</h1>
<p>There are three ways to install Limnoria depending on your operating system. If you are on Debian-based Linux distribution e.g. Debian, *Ubuntu you can install the Debian package. Or then you can install from source which should work on all other OSes too (at least Mac OS X, I don't have successful experience with Windows) and you can also install for current user only.</p>
<h2 id="with-the-debian-package">With the Debian package</h2>
<p><strong>This method requires root access.</strong></p>
<p>First become root by running</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo su</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then download the Debian package. Here you have to choice do you install the stable version or testing version.</p>
<p>Replace &quot;VERSIONHERE&quot; with &quot;master&quot; to get stable version or &quot;testing&quot; to get unstable version.</p>
<pre><code>wget http://compiler.progval.net/limnoria-VERSIONHERE-HEAD.deb
dpkg -i limnoria-VERSIONHERE-HEAD.deb
apt-get install -f</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;apt-get install -f&quot; tries to fix broken packages by downloading and installing missing depedencies if there are them.</p>
<h3 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h3>
<p>To upgrade just run the steps above. Remember that the Debian packages are daily builds, so they are changed every day. You can see the latest change on [compiler.progval.net]. The &quot;-HEAD&quot; packages are always the most recent version.</p>
