*Or why am I using umode -iI and thus showing all channels that I am on at
IRC? So you can find channels that may interest you if we have similar
interests.*

People ask this question from me a lot, often the same people as they don't
remember my answer.

I am in umode -iI which shows the channels that I am on so if you think
that I seem sane or interesting or whatever person and feel like you have
similar interests, you can simply `/whois Mikaela` to see the public
channels that I am on and join if you see anything interesting.

But what about the trolls? I haven't had many trolls following me around
and if that happens to you, you can simply send logs to network operators
and if they are good opers, they will take action.

*Update on 2015-04-13: add umode -I which is the InspIRCd way of hiding
all channels from whois depending on the modules loaded and IRCd config.*
