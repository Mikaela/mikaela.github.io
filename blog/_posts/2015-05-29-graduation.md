As my blog is so full of suicidality and depression and how I won't
graduate, I probably must inform here that I have graduated according to
YLE News.

  - YLE had apparently changed their URL breaking the old link and when
    I was informed of this, I tried to search the current live version,
    but was only able to find it from Waybackmachine.

  - Note that Google Translate changes my name to "Finnish Mikaela" as
    Suomalainen means a Finn or Finnish or similar.

What happens next? Nothing until I am legally recognized as a woman which
currently seems to happen in winter at soonest. As I have told everyone,
I won't be applying anywhere with my current person identification number
as all databases mark me as a man and I don't want to have weird situations
like I currently have e.g. student information system separates by gender
and puts Mikaela Suomalainen in the middle of men which raises questions…

What is said in previous posts still applies, I am not moving outdoors
unless I have to which means visit to Helsinki where I am able to move more
freely.
