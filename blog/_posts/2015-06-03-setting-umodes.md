_As I have written more about umodes than I thought, I am breaking the posts
setting/unsetting is documented here and I will link here from other posts._

Simply use `/umode +mo-des` or if that is unknown command (as it's alias in most
of clients), use `/mode YOURNICK +mo-des` and you set umodes "mo" and unset
"des". _These might not be real umodes and they are here just as an example._

## Automatic umodes

Umodes aren't remembered across connections so you must configure your client to
(un)set them automatically. **Your umodes won't be change this way until you
reconnect!**

_These examples use the umodes that I am using at the time of writing._

- HexChat: Open network list, select network and click `edit`, open tab
  `Connect commands`, click `add` and type `umode -iI+wRQxg`.
- WeeChat
  - Old way: `/set irc.server_default.command /mode $nick -iI+wRQxg`
  - Modern way (1.7+): `/set irc.server_default.usermode -iI+wRQxg`
  - _For setting umodes only for one network instead of them all replace
    server_default with server.name, e.g._
    - `/set irc.server.liberachat.usermode -iI+wRQxg`
- ZNC:
  - Traditional way: `/msg *status loadmod perform` and
    `/msg *perform add mode %nick% -iI+wRQxg`
    - The same can also be done in webadmin and if you load perform for user
      level, adding the command `mode %nick% -iI+wRQxg` will set umode -iI+wrqXG
      on all networks.
    - The modes will apply to all networks if you load it on user level or only
      the invidual network on network level.
  - Modern way: [ZNC issue #1221](https://github.com/znc/znc/issues/1221)

### And what these umodes mean

This list is what I want the umodes to mean when I set them automatically. For
what the actual umodes are on your network, try `/quote help umode` or
`/quote help umodes`.

- i — invisible, hides your channel list from whois with ircd-seven and possibly
  some other ircds. Also hides you from /who of people who don't share channels
  with you. [See also why I unset
  it here.]({% post_url blog/2015-03-26-umode--i %})
- I — On InspIRCd with [hidechans] module hides your channel list from whois.
- w — receive wallops, less-important announcements from network operators that
  are only received by those who are curious and have umode +w. More important
  announcements are usually global notices.
- R — block PMs from unidentified users (who tend to be spambots and if they
  aren't, they can identify to services).
- Q — block channel redirects on Charybdis (mode +f or banforward).
- x — activates IRCd based uncloaking even if it's
  [not that reliable.](https://gist.github.com/maxteufel/1e2cf7ada079c271bd3c)
- g — caller-id, people must be `/accepted` or PMed before they can PM you.
- t — only users using SSL can PM.
