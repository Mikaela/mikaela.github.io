Atheme IRC Services is the most used IRC service package. However many people
have difficulties with registering a channel and then managing it, which I
attempt to help with here. I start by explaining NickServ registration (and as a
bonus HostServ) and then move to channel management and you just cannot talk
about that without mentioning GroupServ too...

## NickServ

You won't be able to do anything unless you register your nick. This is as easy
as `/msg nickserv register PASSWORD someone@example.net`.

Depending on Atheme configuration on the IRC network you are using, you must
verify your email by checking it and copy-pasting the command which starts with
`/msg NickServ verify register` to NickServ.

In case you wish to have multiple nicks in the same account, that is also easy,
just `/nick AltNick` and `/msg nickserv group`. You can see nicks you have by
using `/msg nickserv info yournick` (other people (except IRC operators) cannot
see that part).

Now you should be successfully identified and should configure automatic
identification, I cannot help with it so much, but I can point you to beginning:

- [liberachat's SASL instructions](https://libera.chat/guides/sasl)
- [My instructions for SASL with
  WeeChat]({% post_url blog/2015-03-26-weechat-sasl-simply %})
- [Searx YOURCLIENTHERE SASL](https://search.disroot.org/?q=YOURCLIENTHERE+SASL)
- IRCCloud: edit network and go to advanced settings and you will see box for
  NickServ password.
- KiwiIRC: Check "I have a password" and type your passsword there. Ensure that
  you specified a nick that is grouped to your account.
- Matrix: in the admin room (direct chat with the appservice-irc), say
  `!storepass password` to have the password send with PASS on connect. In case
  of liberachat use `!storepass nick:password` and/or see more information at
  [matrix-appservice-irc wiki].

## HostServ

In case the network you are on has HostServ, you can get vhosts with it. Vhosts
appear in place of your real host/cloaked host, but
[won't hide your IP](https://gist.github.com/maxteufel/1e2cf7ada079c271bd3c).

There are two ways to get a vhost, take one that is offered to everyone or
request something.

- Check `/msg hostserv offerlist` and if you see something you like, you can
  enable it with e.g. `/msg hostserv take $user.irc.example.net` and running
  `/msg hostserv on`.
- Use `/msg nickserv request blah` and when you receive message telling you that
  your requested vhost has been approved use `/msg hostserv on`.

## ChanServ

And finally to the topic which seems to be the most difficult, channel (access)
management.

First register the channel with `/msg ChanServ register #channel` while you are
opped. Now you are free to setup the channel as you wish.

I use the following templates, so I can e.g.
`/msg chanserv flags #channel someone op` instead of
`/msg chanserv flags #channel someone +vVhHoOirtAe`. You can also use the
network defaults that you can see with `/msg chanserv template`.

_This is a bash scripts which is ran like `./cstemplate #channel` and
copy-pasted to ChanServ. It basically allows ops to do everything they could do
anyway by being opped using services and "trusted users" have became regulars on
channels I am on. If a flag doesn't exist on the network you are on, Atheme will
just silently ignore it._

**You should see my cstemplate script here, but the embedding isn't working, to
see it
[please click here to go to the GitHub instance of it](https://github.com/Mikaela/gist/blob/master/irc/atheme/cstemplate).**

Another example using my templates would be
`/msg ChanServ flags #channel !channel-ops op` which would give op permissions
above to users in the !channel-ops group.

## GroupServ

I mentioned groups a little earlier and now I am returning to them. They are a
way to manage flags of group of users very easily by having all users in the
group and just setting flags to the group instead of invidual users.

_GroupServ is undervalued service and it might not be surprising if it's missing
from your network :(_

Start by creating your group `/msg groupserv register !blah` (you might want to
register a more descriptive name).

Next, as in this example this group is going to be op #somewhere we close the
group: `/msg groupserv set !group open off`.

Now there are only two tasks left, making the group op and adding ops there:

- `/msg chanserv flags #channel !blah op`
  - where `op` can still be replaced with `aop` if you are following Atheme
    defaults or some other template you created or your own set of flags.
- `/msg groupserv flags !blah user +c`
  - Repeat as many times as you have ops, to remove ops you simply remove their
    `-c` flag or all flags (`-*`). You will also want to read
    `/msg groupserv help flags` as there is more than I said here.
