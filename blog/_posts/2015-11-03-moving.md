_As this blog is so depressing and full of Kotka, I should mention that I moved
to Lauttasaari (~5km from Helsinki centre) a few days ago._

I think my biggest problems are now over. I can move outside without issues and
there are groups I can visit like HeSeta's gaymer's night where I went on the
first day here to play board games as I got friend with me.

Getting to places is just 2â‚¬ per hour or using season from travel card and works
for all public transport. From Lauttasaari it's hopping to bus and then changing
to another bus or metro/train/tram. Metro is also coming nearby in August when
[West Metro](https://lansimetro.fi/en/home.html) opens.

I don't know about psychiatrical health care yet other than there will be
appointment on coming weeks about arranging it.

_This post is too short for my taste, but so was the previous one about hau._
