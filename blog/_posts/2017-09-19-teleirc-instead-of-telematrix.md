_FAQ at SailfishOS Fan Club: why everything was made worse for Matrix users?_

I am not sure which order should I put the issues with TeleMatrix in and the
first issue is actually multiple interlinked issues and I am just trying to open
it somehow.

---

Issue 1: Matrix display names are based on Telegram real name and not username.
In practive this means that Matrix (and IRC) users won't know what is the
username to use in order to ping a Telegram user.

This was workaroundable by setting Telegram real name into `@username`, but the
new Riot Web mentions broke this.

And as display names at Telegram don't have any limitations (unlike usernames),
everyone who had only UTF-8 characters as their "real name" at Telegram became
"Telegram" at IRC and as there were 5 users named Telegram, the IRC bridge got
easily confused on who is who and lost the connection between Matrix and IRC
users resulting into the IRC bridge repeating everything the Matrix user said
resulting into duplicated messages at Matrix and Telegram.

As requested, I workarounded this by setting quiet on `#jollafanclub` for
`*Telegram*!*@*` preventing anyone whose username nickname included the word
Telegram from saying anything. Thus IRC users were unable to see parts of
discussion with at least 5 users missing.

Issue 2: When Telegram users replied to messages, Telematrix sent the whole
original message to Matrix/IRC.

For Matrix users this wasn't an issue, but the Matrix IRC bridge pastebins every
message that goes over three lines in order to avoid angering IRC ops and
serverside antispam measures.

For example normal message from Telegram user would become this at IRC.

> <https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/PuaTAbMsMmuboFHpHMuLBruj>

_Where I said Telegram, I meant TeleMatrix, and only noticed this later._

Telegram users often reply to each other and when half of the discussion is like
this and requires clicking all the time, IRC users simply cannot follow the
discussion. For some reason I got the impression that Matrix users don't mind if
their messages get unreadable for IRC and Telegram users.

For comparsion, here is how TeleIRC with the current configuration looks like, a
little ugly, but no need to switch apps or click dozens of links.

```

_I am using WeeChat script parse_relayed_msg.pl, normal users would see the
message in the following format:_

- `<T4> <@TelegramUserName> @@OriginalAuthor [Snippet of original message]`

_The double @ is caused by setting username format in TeleIRC config.js to start
with @ in order to remind users that the @ is necessary to ping Telegram users._

_This is technically not an issue in either associated project, so I cannot add
issue links._

Minor(?) technical(?) issues:

- Telegram users appear as separate IRC connections draining resources on both
  matrix.org (running the bridge) and IRC server and freenode has expressed
  being unhappy about idle connections. In case of SailfishOS Fan Club this
  meant 300 additional connections.
  - The Telegram users also cannot be sent private messages and all Matrix/IRC
    users appear as single bot at Telegram, so I don't think it's worth it.
- TeleMatrix isn't currently maintained (to be honest, TeleIRC isn't a lot more
  maintained, but it doesn't have this many/serious issues).

Links:

- Freenode's unhappiness:

  - [matrix-appservice-irc#450: Channels on IRC that contain only matrix users should not be bridged to IRC](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/450)
- BONUS:
  [TeleMatrix sends all joins/parts to Telegram anoying users](https://github.com/SijmenSchoon/telematrix/issues/13)
  - tchncs.de instance is running modified code with this behaviour disabled, I
    had originally forgotten it from this post.

Proposed solution: Changing the middle protocol from IRC to Telegram as Matrix
didn't work as can be read from this article, so everyone is happy.

Matrix users could use TeleMatrix and IRC users TeleIRC so Matrix users wouldn't
suffer any worse experience than before and I wouldn't need to type this
article.

**ISSUE: Telegram bots won't see messages from other bots**, so Telegram would
see everyone and IRC and Matrix wouldn't see each other.
