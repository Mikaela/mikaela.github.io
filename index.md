*On this page I am opening the previous words to ease some concerns on my
gender, sexuality and other things that possibly have nothing to do with
you.*

GirlsLikeUs (trans woman) & AS (Asperger's Syndrome)
----------------------------------------------------

I am not sure what I should say about this. There are just trolls
attacking me too often, because I am *"misleading everyone by acting like a
girl"*. This is simply not the case. I was just misdefined as male at birth
while you probably defined correctly at birth.

Asperger's syndrome again means that I am always not sure what to say,
I have over sensitive senses and I usually say what I mean directly. This
can also be called as *"issues in social situations"*.

Feminist
--------

This one is always misunderstood. I am not after having one gender (there
are probably as many of them as there are people) above another. I am after
equalty fo everyone. Looking from here, LGBTIQ+ people have most of the
issues and especially TIQ.

Sexuality
---------

This one has nothing to do with you, but there are trolls who are worried
that I am *"acting like a girl among sexually desperate online nerds*".
I am not anywhere where sex or sexuality is on-topic at IRC where this was
said. Sadly there are some places which indeed are sexual and I am simply
reporting these and leaving. Most of cases have been took care of.

If you are still more interested on my sexuality than you should, I
identify as *demiromantic asexual*, but you might have heard me call myself
as *demisexual* too.
