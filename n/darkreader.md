The [Dark Reader](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader) configuration I
want in the new interface is:

1. See all options
1. Colors

- Background: `#000000` ("AMOLED Black")
- Text: `#ffb700` ("Amber")

1. Font and more

- Change font: yes
- Font name: `OpenDyslexic` or `Comic Shanns Mono`
  - May require disabling fingerprinting protection. Consider also
    [OpenDyslexic extension](https://github.com/OpenDyslexic/extension)
    which again is incompatible with font changing.

In _Settings_ there is additionally _Detect dark theme_ option which is nice,
but again disables font changing.
