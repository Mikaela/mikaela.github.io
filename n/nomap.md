  The underscore nomap suffix in SSID indicates your desire to opt-out of Wi-Fi
  positioning systems and, in some cases, mass surveillance.

# `_nomap`

_{{ page.excerpt }} This used to be a not so great blog-post and has since
became a hopefully better note to whoever it may concern_

`_nomap` in the end of your SSID will exclude your network from Google, Apple,
WiGLE etc.
[Wikipedia has a more complete list of supporting services.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_positioning_system#Public_Wi-Fi_location_databases)

Microsoft has a separate
[location services opt-out](https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/location-services-opt-out)
which uses MAC addresses instead.

## Why?

Privacy. WiGLE.net may point your home directly just by entering the SSID and
who knows how many similar services there are. While I have been thinking of
this since 2015, there is at least one case where this has been used in 2018:

- [Christian Haschek: The curious case of the Raspberry Pi in the network closet](https://blog.haschek.at/2018/the-curious-case-of-the-RasPi-in-our-network.html)

In the second quarter of 2024, researchers found that Apple allows tracking
Wi-Fi networks that hadn't opted out, including Starlink terminals in Ukraine
and Gaza.

## `_optout`

Legacy from 2015-2016. Used to be part of Microsoft WiFi Sense that shared WiFi
networks and passwords to all contacts.
