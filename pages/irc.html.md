**I am not going to explain what IRC is.**

## Finding me at IRC

I am `umode -i` in all networks, so finding me should be easy, just run

```
/whois NICKNAME NICKNAME
```

in common network that you will find below.

I will use topics in format "name of the network / round robin if any <port>". With "+" in front of port, I mean SSL.
The networks are in alphabedical order.

### foreverchat / irc.foreverchat.net +7029 

I am `Mikaela` at foreverchat.

### freenode / chat.freenode.net +6697

At freenode I am usually `Mikaela` with my primary connection and my mobile 
connection is `Ciblia` or `TDA_Anima` (The Dark Aeon Anima, do you know 
Final Fantasy X?) depending on my mood.

<!--
### irccloud / irc.irccloud.com +6697

I am `Mikaela` at IRCCloud.
-->

### ircnet

At IRCnet I am `Mikaela` and `Ciblia` unless my nicks get stolen. IRCnet 
doesn't have services.

### oftc / irc.oftc.net +9999

I am `Mikaela` at OFTC.

### runehq / irc.runehq.com +6697

I am `Mikaela` at RuneHQ.

## Other things

### My bots

I have some bots at freenode and ircnet, but I don't tell more about them 
than they are [Limnorias] to not make them target to anything.

### Templates which I use with ChanServ primarily on Atheme.

I am op on some channels (I probably shouldn't, but try to tell that to 
them) and I have made some templates to have flags easy to manage.

As you can see from the embedded gist, they are bash scripts and they take 
the channel name as argument when executed.
