**I am going to believe that you already know what IRC is or if you 
don't, you will go elsewhere to find it out before continuing.**

## Important note to channel operators

<!-- This applies to MRA (cis)het transphobic, transmisogynist etc. 
people. If you aren't one, just skip this. -->

> *You only get in fights about gender identity and bots.*

As there have been issues with channel and network operators on their own 
guidelines, I am promising the following to avoid issues.

<hr/>

**THINGS BELOW THIS NOTICE DON'T AFFECT CHANNELS/NETWORKS WHERE I AM 
OP(ER).**

* I won't comment when other people are misgendered or wrong pronouns are 
used about them.
* I will ignore lines with the word `guy`.
    * If the line is somehow important, I might only ignore `guy`.
    * Exception: The line is addressed only to me or small group including 
    me.

* Please refer to me with pronouns `she` or `they`.
    * [Singular they (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-specific_and_gender-neutral_pronouns#Singular_they) has been used as gender 
    neutral since 15th century (14XX).

* If I am misgendered (see two previous lists) using misgendering words or 
the following pronouns or variation of them, **I will take issue.**
    * `he`
    * `he/she`
        * If you are referring to people as `he/she`, you are ignoring 
        that non binary people exist.
        * I have nothing to do with being `he`, I am not any less woman 
        than any cis woman.
        * This isn't gender neutral, as I said it excludes non binary 
        people who don't use those pronouns.
            * [Please see this link if you are referring to people as `he/she`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-specific_and_gender-neutral_pronouns#Singular_they).
    * `heshe`
        * See previous.
        * Also slur often used against \#GirlsLikeUs.

**END OF CONDITIONAL THINGS (WHERE I OP(ER).**

## Finding me at IRC

I am `umode -i` in all networks, so finding me should be easy, just run

```
/whois NICKNAME NICKNAME
```

in common network that you will find below.

I will use topics in format "name of the network / round robin if any <port>". With "+" in front of port, I mean SSL.
The networks are in alphabedical order.

### athemenet / irc.atheme.org +6697

I am `Mikaela` at athemenet.

## chatspike / irc.chatspike.net 6667

I am `Mikaela` at chatspike.

**NOTE: They have SSL issues.**

### foreverchat / irc.foreverchat.net +7029 

I am `Mikaela` at foreverchat.

### freenode / chat.freenode.net +6697

At freenode I am usually `Mikaela` with my primary connection and my mobile 
connection is `Ciblia` or `TDA_Anima` (The Dark Aeon Anima, do you know 
Final Fantasy X?) depending on my mood. My primary channel is also at 
freenode.

<!--
### irccloud / irc.irccloud.com +6697

I am `Mikaela` at IRCCloud.
-->

### ircnet

At IRCnet I am `Mikaela` and `Ciblia` unless my nicks get stolen. IRCnet 
doesn't have services.

### oftc / irc.oftc.net +9999

I am `Mikaela` at oftc.

### piratenet 

I am `Mikaela` at piratenet.

<!--

### quakenet

I am `Mikaela` at quakenet, but their services work differently from 
other services so don't trust on it and this section isn't visible, 
because quakenet enforces `+i`.

-->

### runehq / irc.runehq.com +6697

I am `Mikaela` at runehq.

## Other things

### My bots

I have some bots at freenode and ircnet, but I don't tell more about them 
than they are [Limnorias] to not make them target to anything.

### Templates which I use with ChanServ primarily on Atheme.

As mentioned previously, I am op on some channels and use these templates 
to make managing access list easier on networks using Atheme Services.

* [cstemplate](https://gist.github.com/Mkaysi/597c03e41a20571e10af)
    * Only trusted people who are specified in the ACL will get voice or 
    op status.
* [cstemplate2](https://gist.github.com/Mkaysi/91cc5029ab842b9129fc)
    * cstemplate updated for Atheme exttargets.
    * Every registered user gets auto-voice.
        * If voice is only given to trusted people/regulars or similar, 
        please use cstemplate.
