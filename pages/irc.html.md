I am not going to explain what IRC is.

## Finding me at IRC

I am `umode -i` in all networks, so finding me should be easy, just run

```
/whois NICKNAME NICKNAME
```

in common network that you will find below.

I will use topics in format "name of the network / round robin if any <port>". With "+" in front of port, I mean SSL.
The networks are in random order (or whatever order my clients display them in).

### freenode / chat.freenode.net +6697

At freenode I am usually `Mikaela` with my primary connection and my mobile 
connection is `Ciblia` or `TDA_Anima` (The Dark Aeon Anima, do you know 
Final Fantasy X?) depending on my mood.

I also have channel `##Mkaysi` at freenode.

Oh, and my primary bots are `Yvzabevn` and `Tessu`.

### ircnet

At IRCnet I am `Mikaela` and `Ciblia` unless my nicks get stolen. IRCnet 
doesn't have services.

I have channel `#Mikaela` there which is relayed to `##Mkaysi@freenode`. 
It exists, because I wanted a reason to put `Yvzabevn` there as registering 
to `Tessu` is disabled.

As you probably understood, `Yvzabevn` and `Tessu` are there too. `Tessu` 
has more work at IRCnet than `Yvzabevn`.

### runehq / irc.runehq.com +6697

I am Mikaela at RuneHQ.

### irccloud / irc.irccloud.com +6697

I am Mikaela at IRCCloud.

### foreverchat / irc.foreverchat.net +7029 

I am Mikaela at foreverchat.

### oftc / irc.oftc.net +9999

I am Mikaela at OFTC.

## Bots

My bots are usually [Limnorias.](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria) I am 
Limnoria's Finnish translator and have done some other contributions.

### Yvzabevn

Yvzabevn is my primary bot and it's using Python 3. You can find it's 
[web interface here](http://lakka.kapsi.fi:62291/).

### Tessu

Tessu is my secondary bot (but you could call it as primary on IRCnet). It's
named after our dog as some might know and it's configured to use Finnish.

Tessu doesn't have web interface at the moment.
