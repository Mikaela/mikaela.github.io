**I am going to bellieve that you already know what IRC is or if you 
don't, you will go elsewhere to find it out before continuing.**

## Important note to channel operators

<!-- This applies to MRA (cis)het transphobic, transmisogynist etc. 
people. If you aren't one, just skip this. -->

> *You only get in fights about gender identity and bots.*

As there have been issues with channel and network operators on their own 
guidelines, I am promising the following to avoid issues.

<hr/>

**THINGS BELOW THIS NOTICE DON'T AFFECT CHANNELS/NETWORKS WHERE I AM 
OP(ER).**

* I won't comment when other people are misgendered or wrong pronouns are 
used about them.
* I will ignore lines with the word `guy`.
    * If the line is somehow important, I might only ignore `guy`.
    * Exception: The line is addressed only to me or small group including 
    me.

* Please refer to me with pronouns `she` or `they`.
    * [Singular they (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-specific_and_gender-neutral_pronouns#Singular_they) has been used as gender 
    neutral since 15th century (14XX).

* If I am misgendered (see two previous lists) using misgendering words or 
the following pronouns or variation of them, **I will take issue.**
    * `he`
    * `he/she`
        * If you are referring to people as `he/she`, you are ignoring 
        that non binary people exist.
        * I have nothing to do with being `he`, I am not any less woman 
        than any cis woman.
        * This isn't gender neutral, as I said it excludes non binary 
        people who don't use those pronouns.
            * [Please see this link if you are referring to people as `he/she`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-specific_and_gender-neutral_pronouns#Singular_they).
    * `heshe`
        * See previous.
        * Also slur often used against \#GirlsLikeUs.

**END OF CONDITIONAL THINGS (WHERE I OP(ER).**

## Finding me at IRC

I am `umode -i` in all networks, so finding me should be easy, just run

```
/whois NICKNAME NICKNAME
```

in common network that you will find below.

I will use topics in format "name of the network / round robin if any <port>". With "+" in front of port, I mean SSL.
The networks are in alphabedical order.

At freenode I am usually `Mikaela` with my primary connection and my mobile 
connection is `Ciblia` or `TDA_Anima` (The Dark Aeon Anima, do you know 
Final Fantasy X?) depending on my mood. My primary channel is also at 
freenode.

## Other things

### My bots

I have some bots at freenode and ircnet, but I don't tell more about them 
than they are [Limnorias] to not make them target to anything.

### Templates which I use with ChanServ primarily on Atheme.

I am op on some channels (I probably shouldn't, but try to tell that to 
them) and I have made some templates to have flags easy to manage.

As you can see from the embedded gist, they are bash scripts and they take 
the channel name as argument when executed.

      m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
