**[Suomeksi](channel.fi.html)**

Rules of channel X in network Y.<br/>The channels which use these rules should
link to this page in ENTRYMSG (or other automatic msg by bot) or topic. Channel
URL is not so good as many clients hide it somewhere (which actually happens
with everything else than topic)

_[More about my bot (which might or might not be on this channel) here.](bot.html)_

- **Use common sense.**
- Be nice, no discrimination
  - Mind your language, not everyone is e.g. your brother ("bro"), don't swear
    or use slurs.
  - In case you aren't sure which pronouns to use about someone else, please use
    [singular they](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they)
  - Clearly tell when links aren't safe for everyone by prefixing them with
    `[NSFW]` or similar.
  - Respect boundaries, don't PM people without asking first.
    - _You may PM ops or ops may PM you if it's required for solving potential
      channel issue peacefully._
- Don't log the channel publicly.
- Don't bring bots to the channel without asking ops first.

_These rules also affect (h)ops (and higher), if you see them breaking these
rules, please do say it._

- If you need help from channel op...
  - ping or PM them (but keep in mind they might be blocking all PMs)
  - if the network supports it and you have correct flags (voice?),
    `/msg memoserv sendops #channel <the issue>`
  - `!ops` might work if the ops are highlighting on it or there is bot handling
    it, but it's not as recommended as the other ways.
  - if there are no ops present, try contacting the network operators, they
    should have flags to help.
