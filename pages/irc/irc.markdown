IRC has been a big part of my life, I discovered it during junior high school
and have several friends and communities there. This is also shown by the amount
of blog posts, I have below.

I am running my own [IRC@Etro](ircs://etro.mikaela.info:6697/#mikaela.info)
([webchat](https://irc.etro.mikaela.info/)) and oper on a couple of other
networks too. For a list of my registered IRCaccounts in general, please see
[txt/irc.txt](/txt/irc.txt) and [my discuss page](/discuss) for registered
channels outside of IRC@Etro.
