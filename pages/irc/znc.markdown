## ZNC

Vardiera is hosting stable ZNC (latest git tag) where people I trust can get
accounts.

### Simple rules

- Follow the network policies.
- Follow the channel rules.
- You use this ZNC by your own responsibility.
  - accounts can be removed at any time.
  - it can crash any time without me being there to fix it.
  - it can be restarted any time to install upgrades.
- No logging unless you load the log module by yourself (log access requires
  shell access which I don't give!)
- If you use the [SASL](http://wiki.znc.in/sasl) or
  [NickServ](http://wiki.znc.in/nickserv) module, your password is stored in
  plain text.
  - I won't ever read it there, but I think it should be mentioned. Don't use
    server password unless you have to as that password is thrown to my eyes in
    ZNC startup messages.
- In case more networks are needed, contact me.

### Tips & tricks

1. Read the [ZNC wiki], at least [FAQ].
2. **Load savebuff** so your buffers aren't lost on restart/crash/etc.
   - **Don't specify a password or I am going to be angry and you are going to
     lose your account!**
3. If your network has NickServ,
   [load SASL and read it's wiki page for automatic identification.](http://wiki.znc.in/sasl)

experience smoother.

### Webchat

1. Check "I have a password" and type `username/network:password`.
