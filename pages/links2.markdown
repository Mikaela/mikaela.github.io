*This page has some kind of link list on minorities which mostly somehow
affect me and is probably always under construction. The order is somewhat
random and [improvements are welcome here.](https://github.com/Mikaela/mikaela.github.io/edit/master/pages/links2.markdown)*

*This page is also in need of attention.*

    * *So if the law requires that a person is male or female, should that
      sex be assigned by anatomy, hormones, cells or chromosomes, and what
      should be done if they clash? “My feeling is that since there is not
      one biological parameter that takes over every other parameter, at
      the end of the day, gender identity seems to be the most reasonable
      parameter,” says Vilain. In other words, if you want to know whether
      someone is male or female, it may be best just to ask.*
