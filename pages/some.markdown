*Notice on XMPP: I am not going to monitor any others than Diaspora & Kapsi
 accounts, if you wish to contact me using it, use either of those.*

* [Facebook Messenger](https://m.me/mikaelahmsuomalainen)
    * I only previously accepted friend requests from people I knew
      anywhere like IRC, but I have moved to just accepting all requests
      as long as I have some kind of idea on the person and they seem sane.
      If I know you at IRC or somewhere, sending message with mentioning of
      that would be helpful. **If you don't send me message telling me
      where I know you and who you are there, you might have to wait for
      a very long time...**
* [GitHub](https://github.com/Mikaela)
    * I used to have different account which is currently organization
      including forks where I don't contribute so actively.
* [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11147845-mikaela-suomalainen)
    * You should be asked *Where do I know you from or why we should be
      friends?*, if you are unsure how to reply, check Facebook.
