<h1>Top-posting</h1>

<h2>What is top-posting?</h2>

<p>Top posting is replying before the text which you are replying to (and which is usually automatically quoted by your email client).</p>

<p>This example from <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/FAQsFromDebianUser#What_is_top-posting_.28and_why_shouldn.27t_I_do_it.29.3F">Debian wiki</a> answers to both, this and next question.</p>

<pre><code>A: Because it messes up the way you read
Q: Why is top-posting bad?

<h2>Why is it bad?</h2>

<p>See the answer to the previous question. It explains everything.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>At least <a href="http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct">Debian mailing lists</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/support/community/mailinglists">Ubuntu mailing lists</a> forbid top-posting in their guidelines. In my opinion other mailing lists should do this too.</p>
