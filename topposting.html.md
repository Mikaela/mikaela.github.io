Top-posting
===========

What is top-posting?
--------------------

Top posting is replying before the text which you are replying to (and which is usually automatically quoted by your email client).

This example from [Debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/FAQsFromDebianUser#What_is_top-posting_.28and_why_shouldn.27t_I_do_it.29.3F) answers to both, this and next question.

    A: Because it messes up the way you read
    Q: Why is top-posting bad?
    A: Writing your answer before the question
    Q: What is top-posting?

Why is it bad?
--------------

See the answer to the previous question. It explains everything.

Rules
-----

At least [Debian mailing lists](http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct) and [Ubuntu mailing lists](http://www.ubuntu.com/support/community/mailinglists) forbid top-posting in their guidelines. In my opinion other mailing lists should do this too.
