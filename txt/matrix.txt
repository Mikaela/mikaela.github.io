My Matrix accounts
==================

Having multiple accounts on different homeservers is preferable for many reasons such as ensuring decentralisation of power and being able to manage rooms from multiple places even with federation meltdown.

Primary accounts
----------------

* matrix:u/aminda:pikaviestin.fi - main
* matrix:u/mikaela.suomalainen:matrix.org - professional context where shouldersurfing may be a concern. Also Element-{X,Android,iOS}. (Predates my December 2021 namechange a bit)

Others
------

* matrix:u/Ciblia:matrix.org - ~2016 retro MXID (nowadays they aren't allowed to have capital letters which I did by accident)
* matrix:u/aminda:matrix.org - https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/17483
* matrix:u/aminda:mozilla.org https://github.com/flathub/im.riot.Riot/issues/268#issuecomment-1103213448
* matrix:u/aminda:tedomum.net
* matrix:u/mikaela:pirateriot.net
* matrix:u/mikaela:tchncs.de
* matrix:u/mkaysi:fedora.im - https://github.com/flathub/im.riot.Riot/issues/268#issuecomment-1103213448
* matrix:u/aminda:dendrite.matrix.org - Dendrite test account and my only at the moment
* matrix:u/aminda:conduit.ungleich.ch - IPv6 Conduit test account, but as they may erase database at all times, it may not be me.

Bots
----

* matrix:u/mikaela.matterbridge:tedomum.net - currently used, migrating to jae.fi
* matrix:u/aminda.matterbridge:jae.fi - partially used, migrating from ^
* matrix:u/aminda.git:pirateriot.net - Gitea webhooks (access token on multiple instances), Matrix doesn't have scopped access tokens yet https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2967

Old bots
--------

* matrix:u/mikaela.matterbridge:converser.eu - inactive previous iteration

Bridges
-------

Please refer to irc.txt, telegram.txt and xmpp.txt

Deactivated accounts
--------------------

These accounts are deactivated and thus no longer usable by anyone. If they reappear, assume malicious homeserver and ACL on sight.

* matrix:u/aminda:the-apothecary.club - used to exist for accessibility testing animated avatars e.g. https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/18442 and https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/issues/841 . I disagree with how they run their communities and thus have deactivated the account myself.

Legacy
------

These homeservers no longer exist and should they reappear it's most likely not me, please kban on sight unless otherwise stated.

* matrix:u/mikaela:disroot.org
* matrix:u/mikaela:privacytools.io
* matrix:u/mikaela:feneas.org
  * matrix:u/mikaela-matterbridge:feneas.org was the first matterbridge account
* matrix:u/mikaela:liberta.casa

* * * * *

PS. For SSH signature add .sig to the end of the URL
